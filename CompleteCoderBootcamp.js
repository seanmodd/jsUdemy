Our First Conditional Exercise
Let's get some practice with conditional statements!  In order to make your code repeatable and testable, I'm asking you to write your code inside a pre-defined function (something we have not yet covered in the course).

You will automatically have access to a variable called num.  Please do not try and define num or change num in any way! I will be setting the value of num when I test your code, so that I can test different outcomes

If num is an even number, print out "even".  Don't do anything if num is an odd number.

fullAddress should point to a string that includes the address, city, state, and zipcode from the restaurant object.

To make it harder to "cheat" by copy and pasting, I've randomly generated the address portion.    For example, if address was "64 Johnson Ave", the fullAddress variable would look like this:

Hints:

Remember that strings are immutable, meaning that you cannot simply change the first letter in the original string.  You will need to make a new string that you return.

Single out the first letter and capitalize it. (use a string method to help!)

Add that first letter to the rest of the original string, sliced to omit the original first letter (use a string method to help!)
